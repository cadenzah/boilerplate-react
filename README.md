    - `index.js`
    - `component.css`
    - `component.test.js`
- `/containers` for container components
- `/pages` for page per each routings
  - All routings indexed in `App.js`
- `/utils` for utility functions
- `/redux` for redux store and reducers settings in Ducks pattern

## Appendix

### Tips for using React Router

#### Webpack Dev Server

As Webpack Dev Server(WDS) does not serve `index.html` for routes except `/` as default config, we should set relevant configuration.

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  output: {
    publicPath: '/'
  },

  // ...
  devServer: {
    histroyApiFallback: true
  }
}
```

You should set `publicPath` property to `/`, so that the WDS can understand real root (/) even when you are on subroutes. [See this article](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50179280/9341051).

#### Storybook

If your component use `withRouter()` HoC and use relevant props within itself(i.e. `history.push()`), that component has to be wrapped with `<Router />`. You can use `<MemoryRouter />` to mock the routing environment.

```js
// Component.stories.js
import { MemoryRouter } from 'react-router'

storiesOf('MainButton', module)
  .addDecorator(story => <MemoryRouter initialEntries={['/']}>{story()}</MemoryRouter>)
  .add('default', () => (
      <ComponentWithRouter />
    )
  )
```
